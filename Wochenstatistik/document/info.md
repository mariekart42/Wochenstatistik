# Instructions for Running the Wochenstatistik Program

Please ensure that the following files are placed in the `document` folder for the program to function correctly:

1. `Daten Wochenstatistik.xlsx`
2. `Nutzer Liste.txt`

The program will not work if:
- The file names are misspelled.
- The file types are incorrect.
- The files are not provided.

#### 'Daten Wochenstatistik.xlsx':
- This file should be an Excel sheet that provides the up-to-date values required for generating the correct weekly statistics.

#### 'Nutzer Liste.txt':
- This file contains a list of users who expect to receive an email with their personal statistics.
- For more information, open the `Nutzer Liste.txt` file.
